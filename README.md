Abstract: Mozambique reported the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in March 2020 and it has since spread to all provinces in the country. To investigate the introductions and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Mozambique, 1 142 whole genome sequences sampled within Mozambique were phylogenetically analyzed against a globally representative set, reflecting the first 25 months of the epidemic. The epidemic in the country was marked by four waves of infection, the first associated with B.1 ancestral lineages, while the Beta, Delta, and Omicron Variants of Concern (VOCs) were responsible for most infections and deaths during second, third, and forth waves. Large-scale viral exchanges occurred during the latter three waves and were largely attributed to southern African origins. Not only did the country remain vulnerable to introductions of new variants but these variants continued to evolve within the borders of the country. Due to the Mozambican health system already under constraint, and paucity of data in Mozambique, there is a need to continue to strengthen and support genomic surveillance in the country as VOCs and Variants of interests (VOIs) are often reported from the southern African region.

## Figure legends:

Figure 2: SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological dynamics in Mozambique (A) Schematic illustration of genomic and epidemiological data. Changes in the daily reported COVID-19 cases are indicated in blue, the cumulative death count associated with COVID-19 disease in orange, and the estimated Re values are indicated in purple. (B) Geographic map of Mozambique illustrating the origin and count genome sequences generated in this study. Genome sequences without information on the province from which it originated were omitted from this graph.

Figure 3: Lineage and Phylogenetic Analysis. (A) Phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 sequences representing global and Mozambique subsets during the first 25 months of the pandemic. Taxa obtained from Mozambique are illustrated with circles and the lines represent taxa from the global dataset. (B) Lineage through time plots illustrate the change in genetic diversity of sequenced genomes sampled in Mozambique throughout the study period.
